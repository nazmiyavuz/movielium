# Movielium

- I designed this app according to the MVC design pattern.
- I used [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) in this project to show images from remote server.

‼️`Note:` You have to add APIKey at line 22 in Endpoint.swift in order to fetch data from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/). It's hidden by .gitignore.
